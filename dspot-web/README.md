## Running

```
cd dspot-web
npm install
npm run-script start

## Implementation

It is built by using MEAN (Mongodb,Express,AngularJS and Nodejs) stack, therefore it will be fetching data from database Mongodb and dynamically represent the data on the templated webpages with AngularJS for the Front-End part. Routing on the Back-End will be done by Nodejs and Expressjs to handle requests from the client and communication with the database.
